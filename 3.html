      (HTML)</a> is the
    standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
    and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
    or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML
    describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms
  to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often
  just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
  dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
  functions.
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
  World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page
  behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web
  browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the
  user's device.
  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
  and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces
  (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
  structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
  The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
  networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or
  other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
  JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are
  now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a
  variety of applications.
  Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.v
